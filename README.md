# Registration_model
# Registration System

This project implements a simple **Registration System** using Python and MySQL. It allows users to register and store their data (name, email, date of birth, etc.) in a MySQL database. The system supports basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing registrations.

## Features

- **Create**: Register a new user.
- **Read**: View registration details of a specific user.
- **Update**: Modify the details of an existing user.
- **Delete**: Remove a user from the registration system.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project on your local machine, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **MySQL Server**: A running MySQL server. Download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
- **MySQL Workbench** (Optional): A GUI tool to manage your MySQL databases. Download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/registration-system.git
cd registration-system
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It’s best practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate the virtual environment.

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Required Dependencies
Install all necessary Python libraries by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the mysql-connector-python library, which is required to connect to the MySQL database.

4. Set Up MySQL
Create a new MySQL database (e.g., registration_system) and set up the table. You can do this by running the SQL script provided in db/create_table.sql.

Steps to set up MySQL:

Log in to your MySQL server using a MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench or the command line).

Create a new database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE registration_system;
Run the SQL script to create the Registration table:

sql
Copy code
source db/create_table.sql;
This will create the necessary table to store registration data.

5. Configure Database Connection
In the config/db_config.py file, update the MySQL connection settings with your database credentials:

python
Copy code
DATABASE_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'root',           # Replace with your MySQL username
    'password': 'your_password',  # Replace with your MySQL password
    'database': 'registration_system'
}
6. Run the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the CRUD operations by running:

bash
Copy code
python src/crud_operations.py
You can modify the script to test different CRUD operations like Create, Read, Update, or Delete.

Usage
Creating a New Registration:

To create a new registration, you can call the create_registration() function, which will insert a new user record into the database.

Example:

python
Copy code
create_registration('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '1990-05-12', '1234567890', '123 Main St')
Reading a Registration:

To retrieve the details of a specific registration, call the read_registration() function with the user’s ID.

Example:

python
Copy code
read_registration(1)
Updating a Registration:

To update a registration, call the update_registration() function and specify the ID of the user you want to update.

Example:

python
Copy code
update_registration(1, name='Johnathan Doe', phone='0987654321')
Deleting a Registration:

To delete a registration, use the delete_registration() function and pass in the ID of the registration you wish to remove.

Example:

python
Copy code
delete_registration(1)

### 3. **Save the File**
- Once you’ve copied the content above, save the `README.md` file in the root directory of your project (in the `registration-system` directory).

---

### 4. **Adjust `README.md` as Needed**
- **Replace Placeholder Information**: Don’t forget to replace placeholders like `your-username` with your actual GitHub username or project-specific information (e.g., `root`, `your_password`, and `your_database`).
- **Test Instructions**: Make sure to follow all setup steps to ensure they work correctly for your specific environment.

Now your `README.md` file will serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone setting up, using, or contributing to your project!
